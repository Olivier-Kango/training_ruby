Store data in files

One way to persist data between  uses is to just store it in a file. In this lesson, you will learn how to do this.

Eventually you will need to preserve data from your program. In this cas wrtiting to a file is a good choice. Before actually wrtiting your data you will have to figure out how to represent in the file and how to read it back into your application.

For example, if your application is storing lists of names your format can be to put one name per line in the file. This means that when writing you put a newline after every name and when reading the file you know that names are separeted by a newline.
